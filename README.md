# Musl-LFS-s6-Bootscripts
Bootscripts for Musl-LFS (MLFS) using S6

This is based on the works of Obarun Linux (http://web.obarun.org/) and Skarnet (https://skarnet.org/).

The aim of this project is to create the scripts and files to boot a MLFS system with S6 and S6-rc. This will replace the LFS bootscripts that LFS uses to boot a LFS system with SysVinit or systemD.

** This is still a work in porgress, and may not boot. Please wait for the first release **
