### Things to do before hardware halt/reboot/poweroff.
### Ideally, it should be a single call to the service manager,
### telling it to bring all the services down.

### If your s6-linux-init-maker invocation was made with the -1
### option, messages from rc.shutdown will appear on /dev/console
### as well as be logged by the catch-all logger.
### If your s6-linux-init-maker invocation did NOT include the -1
### option, messages from rc.shutdown will only be logged by the
### catch-all logger and will NOT appear on /dev/console. In order
### to print them to /dev/console instead, you may want to
### uncomment the following line:
# exec >/dev/console 2>&1

### Services are managed by s6-rc:
exec s6-rc -bda change
